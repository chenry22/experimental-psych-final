# Experimental Psych Final
This respository contains the PsychoPy experiment I created for my PSYCH301 final project during Spring 2024! This project uses PsychoPy v2023.2.1 (may not run properly using different versions).

## Project Layout
- The **.psyexp** file contains the actual project which can be opened up, edited, and run using the PsychoPy Runner
- The **conditions.xlsx** files defines all conditions used during the experiment.
- the **/images** directory holds the images used during the experiment, as well as some backups/previous versions used

## The Memory Color Effect
The goal of this experiment was to further analyze the **Memory Color Effect**, which refers to the knowledge or expectation of a typical color of some object. Objects which trigger this expectation are referred to as "color diagnostic", while objects that do not have an expected color are "non-diagnostic".

In this experiment we hoped to learn whether diagnostic objects are more attention-grabbing than non-diagnostic objects. We hoped to build off of the results of a [previous experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-023-02714-4) by Cutler et al. which analyzed a similar effect using the flicker paradigm. My experiment takes a different approach, using a more conventional metric of attention based on the method of Bockler et al. in a [different attention experiment](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613516147).
